# Heat flow of toxic gas across catalytic convertor

The catalytic convertor given was discretized into 1mm x 1mm x 1mm cubes in cartesian
coordinates to model heat flow. The temperature change of each volume element was
numerically calculated by iterating through all volume elements using equations 1 and 2.

1. 

$Q = \frac{Î”T}{total\ resistance}$

2. 

$total\ resistance = R_{centre} + R_{neighbour} + R_{thermal/ contact}$
